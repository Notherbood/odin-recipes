    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Homemade potato chips are fun and easy. 
    Guaranteed they won't last long! A food processor with a slicing 
    attachment is very helpful for slicing the potatoes. Experiment with 
    the thickness; you may like them thicker or thinner. I like to use 
    olive oil for frying, but you can use safflower, corn, or peanut oil 
    as well as vegetable oil.</p>
